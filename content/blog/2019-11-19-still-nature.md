..mission failed to a kakhetian adventure: came too late to the marshutka. 

I discover the samgori bazaar: after the one in Station Square this one is quite special.

Here russian appears to be more widely spoken than georgian and when I heard georgian it felt like it was spoken backwards. 

The Market is next to the railway station, is smaller, yet it has more presence than Station Square: here it is difficult to get lost: you are push to explore it: to absorb every single color, every bit of perfume: it is not a dazing experience, not a labyrinth, not the evolution of the social condition: Samgori Bazar is a still nature.

I personally enjoyed this market more than Station Square maybe because is smaller and new to me, however it is too far away: this city feels like an entire country.

There is also a section of second hand clothes quite amazing and with good quality stuff.

A lady selling plastic bags of different sizes and colors was a poem by herself among fruit and clothes vendors, she looked incredibily sad and by consequences of proximity so did the plastic bags.

Another old lady asked me if was nigerian: I bought a head scarf from her shop: I wore it once since then.

I was gifted maroni and grapes.

The spice’s babushke seem to untrust any attempt at communication: bought pepper and the old lady thought I was stealing it after I gave her the money; bought laurel from another babushka who decided to withhold the change and pretendeded I vanished from her sight: realizing I was not buying the trick she gave me a teethless smile and the change: that smile was worth the change alone.

The fruit vendors kept telling me prices in russian: good thing I know how to count until five.

Bought a ton of italian tomatos. They weren’t that good: the georgian tomatos are infinite times better and tastier and bigger.

I did not buy mushrooms cause the mushroom lady was arguing with the herbs lady next to her: I did not want to interrupt such passionate conversation to buy 4 mushrooms. They were arguing in russian

On the entrance to the Samgori metro four babushke, all dressed in black, evergreen widows, were selling four naked chickens tightly wrap in plastic film: four widows on the left, four chicken on the right just before the steps down: a silent, raw, performance. 

A gipsy on the metro was pretending to be a widow and walked along the carriages as she were in a solitary procession with an icecream box for the collection of charity.
